# BattleMcAPI
An API abstraction layer for Minecraft plugins. The idea of this project is to offer an abstraction layer and easy to understand API for those wanting to support more than just one server software for their plugins. 

Instead of maintaining two or three separate codebases for cross-compatibility or working with Gradle/Maven modules, BattleMcAPI should be able to eliminate those modules or separate projects at the minimum. 

While (as of now) it doesn't completely eliminate the need for using the actual API's, BattleMcAPI should allow you to consildate those modules/extra projects into one and make it a whole lot easier to maintain. With this being said, the only caveat is that you have to completely update the whole project to use BattleMcAPI. We tried to make this as easy as possible by writing BattleMcAPI in a way that is familiar with most all developers.
